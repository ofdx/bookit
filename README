Initial Setup
-------------

There are several steps to deploying this app:
  - Clone the repository
  - Configure nginx
  - Create a bookit_data/ directory and objects.txt device configuration file.
  - Build and run

To start, clone the repo:

	$ git clone https://github.com/ofdx/bookit.git

This should result in a bookit/ direcotry in your current working directory.
Create a bookit_data/ directory in the same directory you just completed the
clone.

	$ mkdir bookit_data

To confirm, the output of ls should show bookit and bookit_data.

	$ ls | grep bookit
	bookit
	bookit_data


Server Configuration
--------------------

BookIt! is a FastCGI service. It runs as a daemon bound to 127.0.0.1:9020. In
order to access it, you must install a web server with FastCGI support. The
supported option is nginx.

In your site configuration (/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/yoursite), add the
following inside of your server{} block:

	# BookIt! Cluster Reservation App
	location /bookit/ {
		include /etc/nginx/fastcgi.conf;
		fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9020;
	}


Device Configuration
--------------------

Devices should be in a file [bookit_data/objects.txt]. Each entry is of the
following format:

	id server1
	name Server 1
	group Example Servers
	
	A description of Server 1's capabilities...
	IP 10.0.0.1
	.


NOTE: The lines are indented here for clarity, but should NOT be indented in
your actual objects.txt file.

NOTE: objects.txt is in the bookit_data/ directory you manually created.


The first section is a list of key-value pairs including:

 	id
	  - Must be unique and should be a single word with no spaces.

	name
	  - What will be shown in the UI.

	group
	  - General category of this object.
	  - Objects with the same group will be displayed together in the UI.


A single empty line separates the first section of key-value pairs from the
description text. Description text can be many lines long and terminates
with a single dot (.) on its own line.


Build and Run
-------------

The macro script can be used to build, start, and stop the service. If you
cloned the repository to bookit/, you can build it with:

	$ bookit/macro run

Always use this macro script to control BookIt!. The following commands are
useful:
	bookit/macro [all]
	  - Build if necessary.

	bookit/macro run
	  - Build if necessary, start or restart the service.

	bookit/macro stop
	  - Stop the service.

	bookit/macro clean
	  - Delete build output.


About Reservations
------------------

Reservations are stored in a text file called [reservations.txt]. Each line
is a reservation, and includes: id, start, end, session, info

Example: Server 1 is reserved for one hour by ofdx.

	server1 1704479574 1704483174 abcd1234b64 ofdx 

This file is written when reservations are updated, and is reloaded at startup
so that the application crashing does not result in a loss of reservation data.
There is no need to manually create this file.
